 Hello:
 this project is easy, and i can explain it so fast
 1. the data is very simple and it is about 10000 Rows
 2. it has 8 columns (id: film_id, genre_ids: the ids for genre of this film {this point is clear in python file}, title, popularity: the number of film popularity with max value = 4696.546, release_data, vote_average, vote_count)
 3. i am creating python script to ^lookup^ genre_ids with actual values.
